#### Override tracking
> Before moving forward, I need to know what changes should be tracked and saved. 
> Edge case: What if an override, replaces a file name with same name. 
> We must use proxy to track changes made by overrides and to tackle about edge case.

#### Dataset group names
> For finalizing `quick_editor`, I need to add strict dataset group naming.
> This will require other projects to define all the datasets they are using in the root once.
